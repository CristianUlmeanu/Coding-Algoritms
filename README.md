# Coding-Algoritms
Simple problems solved with different algoritms in C++/C

A set of problems that are solved with different algoritms, to be optimized. The problems were proposed by my university teacher at the "Programming Techniques". The algoritms used were Backtracking, Greedy, Divide et Impera and Dynamic Programming.
